    context = """One of the things everybody in the West knows about China is that it is not a democracy, and is instead a regime run with an iron fist by a single entity, the Chinese Communist Party, whose leadership rarely acts transparently, running the country without the need for primary elections, alternative candidacies, etc.
In general, those of us who live in democracies, with relatively transparent electoral processes, tend to consider the Chinese system undesirable, little more than a dictatorship where people have no say in who governs them.
That said, among the “advantages” of the Chinese system is that because the leadership never has to put its legitimacy to the vote, it can carry out very long-term planning in the knowledge that another administration isn’t going to come along and change those plans.
Obviously, I put “advantages” in quotation marks because, as democrats, most of my readers would never be willing to sacrifice their freedom for greater planning, but there is no doubt that China, since its system works like this and its population seems to have accepted it for generations, intends to turn this into a comparative advantage, the term used in business when analyzing companies.
It turns out that China’s capacity for long-term planning is achieving something unheard of in the West: it seems the country reached peak carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, and that the figures for 2024, driven above all by a determined increase in the installation of renewable energies, are not only lower, but apparently going to mark a turning point.
China and India were until recently the planet’s biggest polluters, but they now offer a model for energy transition (there is still a long way to go; but we are talking about models, not a done deal).
It could soon be the case that the so-called developing countries will be showing the West the way forward."""

1. Begin with a <thinking> section.
2. Inside the thinking section:
   a. Briefly analyze the question and outline your approach.
   b. Present a clear plan of steps to solve the problem.
   c. Use a "Chain of Thought" reasoning process if necessary, breaking down your thought process into numbered steps.
3. Include a <reflection> section for each idea where you:
   a. Review your reasoning.
   b. Check for potential errors or oversights.
   c. Confirm or adjust your conclusion if necessary.
4. Be sure to close all reflection sections.
5. Close the thinking section with </thinking>.
6. Provide your final answer in an <output> section.
Always use these tags in your responses. Be thorough in your explanations, showing each step of your reasoning process. Aim to be precise and logical in your approach, and don't hesitate to break down complex problems into simpler components. Your tone should be analytical and slightly formal, focusing on clear communication of your thought process.
